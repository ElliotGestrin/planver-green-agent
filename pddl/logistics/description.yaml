Actions:
  (load-truck ?obj - object ?truck - object ?loc - object): Load block {b1} from location {l1} into truck {t1}. Requires that block {b1} is a block, truck {t1} is a truck, location {l1} is a location, the truck {t1} is at {l1}, and the block {b1} is at {l1}. After execution, block {b1} is in truck {t1} and no longer at {l1}.
  (load-airplane ?obj - object ?airplane - object ?loc - object): 'Load object {obj} from location {loc} into airplane {airplane}. Preconditions: {obj} is an object at {loc} and {airplane} is an airplane at {loc}. Effects: {obj} is no longer at {loc} and {obj} is in {airplane}.'
  (unload-truck ?obj - object ?truck - object ?loc - object): Unload object {obj} from truck {truck} at location {loc}. Requires that {obj} is an object, {truck} is an object, {loc} is a location, {truck} is at {loc}, and {obj} is in {truck}. After execution, {obj} is no longer in {truck}, and {obj} is at {loc}.
  (unload-airplane ?obj - object ?airplane - object ?loc - object): Unload object {obj} from airplane {airplane} at location {loc}. Requires that {obj} is an object, {airplane} is an object, and {loc} is a location, and that {obj} is in {airplane} and {airplane} is at {loc}. Causes {obj} to no longer be in {airplane} and {obj} to be at {loc}.
  (drive-truck ?truck - object ?loc-from - object ?loc-to - object ?city - object): Drive truck {truck} from location {loc-from} to location {loc-to} in city {city}. Requires that truck {truck} is at {loc-from}, and that both {loc-from} and {loc-to} are in city {city}. After the action, {truck} is no longer at {loc-from} and is now at {loc-to}.
  (fly-airplane ?airplane - object ?loc-from - object ?loc-to - object): Fly airplane {airplane} from airport {loc-from} to airport {loc-to}. Requires that {airplane} is an airplane, {loc-from} is an airport, {loc-to} is an airport, and at({airplane}, {loc-from}). Causes at({airplane}, {loc-from}) to become false and at({airplane}, {loc-to}) to become true.
