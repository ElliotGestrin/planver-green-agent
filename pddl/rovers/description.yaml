Actions:
  (navigate ?x - rover ?y - waypoint ?z - waypoint): Navigate rover {r1} from waypoint {w1} to waypoint {w2}. Requires that {r1} can traverse from {w1} to {w2}, that {r1} is available, that {r1} is currently at {w1}, and that {w1} can see {w2}. After execution, {r1} is no longer at {w1} and is now at {w2}.
  (sample_soil ?x - rover ?s - store ?p - waypoint): 'Sample soil from waypoint {p} using rover {x} and store {s}. Preconditions: rover {x} is at waypoint {p}, there is a soil sample at waypoint {p}, rover {x} is equipped for soil analysis, store {s} contains rover {x}, and store {s} is empty. Effects: store {s} becomes full and empty({s}) becomes false, have_soil_analysis(rover {x}, waypoint {p}) becomes true, and at_soil_sample(waypoint {p}) becomes false.'
  (sample_rock ?x - rover ?s - store ?p - waypoint): Sample a rock at waypoint {p} with rover {x} and deposit it into store {s}. Requires that rover {x} is at waypoint {p}, waypoint {p} contains a rock sample, rover {x} is equipped for rock analysis, store_of({s}, {x}) holds, and store {s} is empty. Causes store {s} to become full (empty({s}) = false), have_rock_analysis({x}, {p}) = true, and at_rock_sample({p}) = false.
  (drop ?x - rover ?y - store): Drop rover {x} into store {y}. Requires that store {y} contains {x} and is full. After the drop, store {y} is not full and becomes empty.
  (calibrate ?r - rover ?i - camera ?t - objective ?w - waypoint): Calibrate the imaging camera {i} on rover {r} for objective {t} at waypoint {w}. Requires that rover {r} is equipped for imaging, objective {t} is a calibration target for camera {i}, rover {r} is at waypoint {w}, objective {t} is visible from waypoint {w}, and camera {i} is on board rover {r}. Causes calibrated({i}, {r}) to be true (camera {i} is calibrated on rover {r}).
  (take_image ?r - rover ?p - waypoint ?o - objective ?i - camera ?m - mode): Take an image of objective {o} from waypoint {p} by rover {r} using camera {i} in mode {m}. Requires that camera {i} on rover {r} is calibrated, on-board, and equipped for imaging, supports mode {m}, objective {o} is visible from waypoint {p}, and rover {r} is at waypoint {p}. Afterward, have_image({r}, {o}, {m}) becomes true and calibrated({i}, {r}) becomes false.
  (communicate_soil_data ?r - rover ?l - lander ?p - waypoint ?x - waypoint ?y - waypoint): 'Communicate soil data for waypoint {p} from rover {r} to lander {l} using waypoints {x} and {y}. Preconditions: rover {r} at {x}, lander {l} at {y}, rover {r} has soil analysis for {p}, {visible(x, y)}, rover {r} is {available}, and lander {l} has a free channel ({channel_free(l)}). Effects: {communicated_soil_data(p)} becomes true; {available(r)} and {channel_free(l)} toggle to false, then return to true.'
  (communicate_rock_data ?r - rover ?l - lander ?p - waypoint ?x - waypoint ?y - waypoint): Communicate rock data from rover {r} to lander {l} about waypoint {p} using visibility between waypoint {x} and {y}. Requires that rover {r} is at waypoint {x}, lander {l} is at waypoint {y}, rover {r} has rock analysis for waypoint {p}, waypoint {x} is visible to waypoint {y}, rover {r} is available, and lander {l} has a free channel. After execution, rover {r} becomes unavailable and then available again, lander {l} frees and then occupies its channel, and rock data for waypoint {p} is marked as communicated.
  (communicate_image_data ?r - rover ?l - lander ?o - objective ?m - mode ?x - waypoint ?y - waypoint): Communicate image data from rover {r} to lander {l} about objective {o} in mode {m} via waypoint {x} to waypoint {y}. Requires that {r} is at {x}, lander {l} is at {y}, {r} has image of {o} in {m}, there is visibility between {x} and {y}, {r} is available, and {l}'s channel is free.
