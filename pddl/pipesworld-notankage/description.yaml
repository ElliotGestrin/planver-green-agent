Actions:
  ? (push-start ?pipe - pipe ?batch-atom-in - batch-atom ?from-area - area ?to-area - area ?first-batch-atom - batch-atom ?product-batch-atom-in - product ?product-first-batch - product)
  : Push-start the first batch-atom-in {batch-atom-in} through pipe {pipe} from area {from-area} to area {to-area}. Requires that pipe {pipe} is normal, the first batch-atom in the pipe is {first-batch-atom}, {from-area} and {to-area} are connected by {pipe}, {batch-atom-in} is on {from-area}, pipe {pipe} is not unitary, {batch-atom-in} is the product {product-batch-atom-in}, the first batch-atom is the product {product-first-batch}, and these products may interface. Causes {pipe} to be updating (true) and not normal (false), makes {first-batch-atom-in} the first in {pipe} and the previous first no longer first, establishes follow({first-batch-atom}, {batch-atom-in}) as true, and moves {batch-atom-in} off {from-area}.
  (push-end ?pipe - pipe ?from-area - area ?to-area - area ?last-batch-atom - batch-atom ?next-last-batch-atom - batch-atom): Push-end transports the batch-atom sequence along pipe {pipe} from area {from-area} to area {to-area}, updating the batch order so that the next batch-atom becomes the last. Requires that push-updating({pipe}) is true, batch-atom {last-batch-atom} is the last for pipe {pipe}, connect({from-area}, {to-area}, {pipe}) holds, pipe {pipe} is not unitary, and follow({last-batch-atom}, {next-last-batch-atom}) holds. After execution, push-updating({pipe}) becomes false, normal({pipe}) becomes true, follow({last-batch-atom}, {next-last-batch-atom}) becomes false, last({next-last-batch-atom}, {pipe}) becomes true, last({last-batch-atom}, {pipe}) becomes false, and on({last-batch-atom}, {to-area}) becomes true.

Effects: {p} is no longer updating and becomes normal; the follow relation between {b2} and {b1} is removed, {b2} becomes the new first batch-atom on {p}, {b1} is no longer the first batch-atom on {p}, and {b1} is placed on area {a_from}.'

Preconditions: {batch-atom-in} is on {from-area}, the pipe is unitary and connects {from-area} to {to-area}, and {batch-atom-in} corresponds to product {product-batch-atom-in} with product {product-first-batch} and may interface between them. Effects: {batch-atom-in} becomes the first (and last) in {pipe}, {first-batch-atom} is no longer first in {pipe}, and {batch-atom-in} is no longer on {from-area} while {first-batch-atom} is now on {to-area}.'
  ? (pop-unitarypipe ?pipe - pipe ?batch-atom-in - batch-atom ?from-area - area ?to-area - area ?last-batch-atom - batch-atom ?product-batch-atom-in - product ?product-last-batch - product)

After the action, {batch-atom-in} becomes the last batch-atom in {pipe}, {last-batch-atom} becomes the first batch-atom and is on {from-area}, and {batch-atom-in} is no longer on {to-area}.
