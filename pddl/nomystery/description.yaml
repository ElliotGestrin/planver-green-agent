Types:
- location
- fuellevel
- locatable
- package
- truck
Predicates:
  (connected ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): Location {l1} is connected to Location {l2}
  (at ?o - locatable ?l - location): Locatable {o} is at location {l}
  (in ?p - package ?t - truck): Package {p} is in Truck {t}
  (fuel ?t - truck ?level - fuellevel): Truck {t} has fuel level {level}
  (fuelcost ?level - fuellevel ?l1 - location ?l2 - location): Fuellevel {level} from location {l1} to location {l2}
  (sum ?a - fuellevel ?b - fuellevel ?c - fuellevel): Fuel level {a} plus fuel level {b} equals fuel level {c}
Actions:
  (load ?p - package ?t - truck ?l - location): Load package {p} into truck {t} from location {l} (package {p}, truck {t}, location {l}). Requires that {p} is at {l} and {t} is at {l} (package {p}, truck {t}, location {l}). Causes {p} to no longer be at {l} and to be in {t}.
  (unload ?p - package ?t - truck ?l - location): Unload package {p} from truck {t} to location {l}. Requires that truck {t} is at location {l} and package {p} is in truck {t}. Causes package {p} to be at location {l} and no longer in truck {t}.
  (drive ?t - truck ?l1 - location ?l2 - location ?fuelpost - fuellevel ?fueldelta - fuellevel ?fuelpre - fuellevel): Drive truck {t} from location {l1} to location {l2}. Requires that {l1} and {l2} are connected, fuel cost from {l1} to {l2} is {fueldelta}, the truck {t} is at {l1}, and fuel at {t} is {fuelpre} with {fuelpre} plus {fueldelta} equaling {fuelpost}. After the action, {t} is at {l2} (no longer at {l1}), and the truck’s fuel changes from {fuelpre} to {fuelpost}.
