  (on-table ?x - object): Object {x} is on the table
  (arm-empty): The arm is empty
  (holding ?x - object): Object {x} is held
  (on ?x - object ?y - object): Object {x} is on object {y}
Actions:
  (pickup ?ob - object): Pickup object {ob}. Requires that object {ob} is clear, on the table, and the arm is empty. Causes object {ob} to be held, object {ob} to no longer be clear, object {ob} to no longer be on the table, and the arm to be not empty.
  (putdown ?ob - object): Put down object {ob}. Requires that {ob} is held. Causes {ob} to be clear, the arm to be empty, {ob} to be on the table, and {ob} to no longer be held.
  (stack ?ob - object ?underob - object): Stack block {b1} on block {b2}. Requires that {b1} is being held and block {b2} is clear. Afterward, {b1} is on {b2}, {b1} is clear and no longer held, {b2} is not clear, and the arm is empty.
  (unstack ?ob - object ?underob - object): Unstack block {b1} from block {b2}. Requires that {b1} is on {b2}, {b1} is clear, and the arm is empty. Causes {b1} to be held, {b2} to become clear, {b1} to no longer be on {b2}, {b1} to become not clear, and the arm to no longer be empty.
